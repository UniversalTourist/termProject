####As a challenge
1. We have 3 csv files and each file contains **different stations** (please, pay attention to station numbers).
2. For **each station**, we need to calculate monthly means.
3. We will plot monthly means for **each station**.
4. We should use **station name** or **number** as plot title, so we can differentiate which plot belong to which station.

####Graphs are done with base R plots. But later will be made by ggplot2.
